# There are two formats to request a key and certificate:
# 1. With details: (Includes `name:`)
# ca_requests:
#   - name: certificate1.example.com
#     passphrase: S3creT
#     cipher: aes256

# 2. Without details: (Does not include `name:`)
# ca_requests:
#   - "{{ ansible_fqdn }}"

# You can also mix these formats:
# ca_requests:
#   - name: certificate1.example.com
#     passphrase: S3creT
#     cipher: aes256
#   - "{{ ansible_fqdn }}"

# Where to publish the certificates, normally a webserver location.
# If not specified, certificates will not be published.
